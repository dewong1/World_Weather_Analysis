# World_Weather_Analysis
Perform analysis, visualization, and statistical skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for a hypothetical travel company (PlanMyTrip)


## Overview of Project

Our task was to collect and analyze weather data aross cities worldwide. Afterwards, PlanMyTrip company will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences. The method was completed by creating a *Pandas DataFrame* with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process entailed 1) **Collecting** (*from JSON file*), 2) **Analyzing** (*scatter plots/heat maps via Google Maps*, and 3) **Visualizing** (*pop-up markers of hotels*) the data.  Data from the JSON file included: *City, country, data*; *Latitude and longitude*; *Maximum temperature*; *Humidity*; *Cloudiness*; and *Wind speed*.

### Purpose and Background

Trying to take the PlanMyTrip app to the next level by adding weather description to the weather data we've already retrieved. We'll have beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose 4 cities to create a travel itinerary. Using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
